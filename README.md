Open-Source Free Scheduler
A simple yet powerful, self-hosted, real-time meeting room booking system built with Node.js and WebSockets. This application is designed to run on tablets mounted at meeting room doors, displaying the current status and schedule.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a free and open-source alternative to expensive subscription-based services for small to medium-sized offices.

ðŸš€ Core Features
Real-Time Updates: Any booking or cancellation made on one device is instantly reflected on all other connected clients.

Multi-Language Support: Supports Azerbaijani, English, and Russian out of the box.

Admin & User Roles: Admins can cancel any booking, while regular users can only manage their own bookings using a PIN.

Dynamic Room Management: Admins can create, rename, or delete rooms directly from the /admin.html dashboard.

Extend Meetings: Ongoing meetings can be extended by 15 or 30 minutes with a single click if the room is available.

Fully Self-Hosted: The application runs entirely on your local network without needing any external internet connection.
